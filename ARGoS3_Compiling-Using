How to compile ARGoS:
Go into the directory argos3-kheperaiv/build_simulator, then run :
$ cmake ../src
And then
$ make
Note : if make has any errors; Fix them.
Then to save this all as a robot for the simulator to use, run
$ sudo make install


To edit the program, go into argos3-kheperaiv/src/plugins/robots/kheperaiv to access the simulator and controller code.
