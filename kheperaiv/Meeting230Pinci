Line 82 kheperaiv_entity.cpp
 - adding the turret entity, and how to set it to the right height (if we need that in the first place)
Line 211 kheperaiv_entity.cpp Init
 - Exact same as above
Line 350 kheperaiv_entity.cpp UpdateComponents - update function for turret entity
 - khepera does have an update function
Line 20 kheperaiv_entity.h
 - is this namespace implementation correct? we do call our turret CKhehperaIVTurretEntity
Line 59 kheperaiv_turret_entity.cpp
 - How does this update function work? Unsure how it even works in the first place, as there is no radius of the robot involved
