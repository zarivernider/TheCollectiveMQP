SAnchor - 
Refernce point origin anchor - center base of khepera 0,0,0
We want a turret anchor 0,0,height of robot
2D phyics engine chipmunk 2 - create a special type of shape (sensorshape) and express position of sensorshape with offset - how / where do we define this offset?
 Since its 2D, don't have to worry about height since they are just top down view
 Spring joint point - need to switch the joint attachment point to the sensor
 - callback adds spring and tells us the force


Chipmunk 2D - body associated to 1 or more shapes
 - body has mass, inertia, pretty sure its defined in kheperaiv_measurements
Created the shape with respect to the body, the position changes are in its initialization
 - addshape

Need updateturretanchor
Also need dynamics2d_footbot_model
